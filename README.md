# üéµ Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning

A project developed for the Signals and Systems course at D√ºzce University, focusing on classifying music genres using machine learning algorithms and evaluating their performance.

## üìå Project Overview

In this project, we aimed to classify music genres automatically using machine learning techniques. The GTZAN dataset, a well-known dataset in audio signal processing, was used. It consists of 1000 audio tracks (10 genres √ó 100 songs), each 30 seconds long.

The main goals were:
- To analyze the performance of different classification algorithms.
- To develop a GUI that allows users to upload music files and classify their genre.

## üß† Algorithms Tested

We used MATLAB's **Classification Learner App** to train and evaluate the following algorithms:

- **Decision Trees**: Fine Tree, Medium Tree, Coarse Tree  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Linear SVM, Quadratic SVM  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Fine KNN, Medium KNN, Coarse KNN  
- **Boosted Trees**
- **Neural Networks**: Narrow Neural Network, Medium Neural Network

### üîç Accuracy Comparison

| Algorithm               | Accuracy   |
|------------------------|------------|
| Quadratic SVM          | **59.82%** |
| Linear SVM             | 58.01%     |
| Medium Neural Network  | 55.30%     |
| Narrow Neural Network  | 52.14%     |
| Boosted Trees          | 49.89%     |
| Coarse Tree            | 40.18%     |
| Medium Tree            | 38.83%     |
| Fine KNN               | 38.15%     |
| Fine Tree              | 36.57%     |
| Medium KNN             | 36.34%     |
| Coarse KNN             | **25.06%** |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- MATLAB & Classification Learner App
- GTZAN Dataset (Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Rock)
- MATLAB App Designer for GUI

## üíª User Interface

The interface was built using **MATLAB App Designer** and includes:

- File upload functionality
- Dropdown menu for algorithm selection
- Frequency spectrum visualization of the uploaded music
- Display of predicted genre

## üìä Key Findings

- **Quadratic SVM** showed the highest accuracy.
- **Linear SVM** and **Medium Neural Network** also performed well.
- **Coarse KNN** had the lowest accuracy and needs further improvement.
- Confusion matrices helped analyze misclassifications in detail.
